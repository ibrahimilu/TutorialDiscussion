1. How to start work with SASS?
--------------------------------
We can create a sample project using SASS and try some CSS and can generate the CSS on the fly using a watcher.
1. Install SASS using the below command.
  
  sudo gem install sass
  
2. Run the following command to run the watcher for SASS file   (styles.scss) this will generate the CSS file on the fly whenever there is a change in this SASS file.
