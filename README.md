If there are some actions we have to execute after finishing another one we can make use of promises.
We can make use of callback as well to execute the function after finishing some other operations. But for asynchronous events it wont be suitable.

Promises in JavaScript give us the ability to write asynchronous code in a parallel manner to synchronous code.
It provide the JavaScript developer a tool for working with asynchronous events.
